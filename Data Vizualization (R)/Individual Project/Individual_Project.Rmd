# Rents in San Francsisco Bay Area 2000-2018

[Kate Pennington](https://www.katepennington.org/data) created a panel
of historic Craigslist rents by scraping posts archived by the Wayback
Machine. You can read more about her work here

[What impact does new housing have on rents, displacement, and
gentrification in the surrounding neighborhood? Read our interview with
economist Kate Pennington about her article, "Does Building New Housing
Cause Displacement?:The Supply and Demand Effects of Construction in San
Francisco."](https://matrix.berkeley.edu/research-article/kate-pennington-on-gentrification-and-displacement-in-san-francisco/)

In our case, we have a clean(ish) dataset with about 200K rows that
correspond to Craigslist listings for renting properties in the greater
SF area. The data dictionary is as follows

| variable    | class     | description           |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| post_id     | character | Unique ID             |
| date        | double    | date                  |
| year        | double    | year                  |
| nhood       | character | neighborhood          |
| city        | character | city                  |
| county      | character | county                |
| price       | double    | price in USD          |
| beds        | double    | n of beds             |
| baths       | double    | n of baths            |
| sqft        | double    | square feet of rental |
| room_in_apt | double    | room in apartment     |
| address     | character | address               |
| lat         | double    | latitude              |
| lon         | double    | longitude             |
| title       | character | title of listing      |
| descr       | character | description           |
| details     | character | additional details    |

The dataset was used in a recent
[tidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

```{r}
# download directly off tidytuesdaygithub repo

rent <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv')
```

What are the variable types? Do they all correspond to what they really
are? Which variables have most missing values?

```{r skim_data}
skimr::skim(rent)
```

```{r}
str(rent)
```
```{r}
colSums(is.na(rent))
```


Make a plot that shows the top 20 cities in terms of % of classifieds
between 2000-2018. You need to calculate the number of listings by city,
and then convert that number to a %.

The final graph should look like this 


```{r top_cities, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "top_cities.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r top_cities2}
rent %>%
  count(city, name = "total_listings") %>%
  mutate(percentage = total_listings / sum(total_listings)) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = total_listings, n = 20) %>%
  mutate(city = fct_reorder(city, percentage)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = percentage, y = city)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    title = "% of Craigslist, 2000 - 2018",
    x = "Listings (in %)",
    y = "City"
  )

```

Make a plot that shows the evolution of median prices in San Francisco
for 0, 1, 2, and 3 bedrooms listings. The final graph should look like
this



```{r sf_rentals, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "sf_rentals.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

```{r sf_median_prices}
rent %>%
  filter(beds %in% 0:3) %>%
  group_by(year, beds) %>%
  summarise(mean_prices = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_prices, color = factor(beds), group = beds)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~beds) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)+
  labs(
    title = "The evolution of median prices in San Francisco",
    subtitle = "0 to 3-bed listings, 2000-2018",
    x = "Years",
    y = "Mean rental prices",
    color = "Beds"
  )

```

Finally, make a plot that shows median rental prices for the top 12
cities in the Bay area. Your final graph should look like this


```{r one_bed_bay_area, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "one_bed_bay_area.png"), error = FALSE)
```



```{r spirit_plot}
# Get top 12 cities by total listings
top_cities <- rent %>%
  filter(!is.na(city)) %>%
  count(city, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 12) %>%
  pull(city)
```

```{r}
# Calculate median prices for 1-bedroom apartments in top cities
bay_area_rent <- rent %>%
  filter(city %in% top_cities,
         beds == 1,
         !is.na(price)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarise(median_price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  filter(!is.na(median_price))
```

```{r}
# Create the faceted plot
bay_area_rent %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = median_price)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = city), size = 1.1) +
  facet_wrap(~city, scales = "free_y", ncol = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(2000, 2018, by = 5),
    limits = c(2000, 2018)
  ) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(scale = 1/1000, suffix = "k")) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Rental prices for 1-bedroom flats in the Bay Area",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Median prices"
  )
```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the
graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

    If we analyze the figures above properly, we can conclude that San Francisco is the most popular city in the Bay Area when it comes to living. We can observe that while rental prices in San Francisco went up, at the same time in almost every neighboring city the rental prices went down, which means that there is little interest in flats in those cities.

    Another observation, after the analyse of the last figure, is that in the last few years, in some neighboring cities, the rental prices for flats with more than one bedroom have started to grow. This could mean that couples or families with children have started moving out of San Francisco to the neighboring areas, which may be quieter.

# Hollywood Age Gap

The website <https://hollywoodagegap.com> is a record of *THE AGE
DIFFERENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN MOVIE LOVE INTERESTS*. This is an
informational site showing the age gap between movie love interests and
the data follows certain rules:

-   The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just
    friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship)
-   The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old
-   No animated characters

The age gaps dataset includes "gender" columns, which always contain the
values "man" or "woman". These values appear to indicate how the
characters in each film identify and some of these values do not match
how the actor identifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered
in the data!

The following is a data dictionary of the variables used

| variable           | class     | description                                                                                             |

| director           | character | Director of the film                                                                                    |
| age_difference     | integer   | Age difference between the characters in whole years                                                    |
| couple_number      | integer   | An identifier for the couple in case multiple couples are listed for this film                          |
| actor_1_name       | character | The name of the older actor in this couple                                                              |
| actor_2_name       | character | The name of the younger actor in this couple                                                            |
| character_1_gender | character | The gender of the older character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple   |
| character_2_gender | character | The gender of the younger character, as identified by the person who submitted the data for this couple |
| actor_1_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the older member of the couple                                                         |
| actor_2_birthdate  | date      | The birthdate of the younger member of the couple                                                       |
| actor_1_age        | integer   | The age of the older actor when the film was released                                                   |

How would you explore this data set? Here are some ideas of tables/
graphs to help you with your analysis

-   How is `age_difference` distributed? What's the 'typical'
    `age_difference` in movies?

-   The `half plus seven\` rule. Large age disparities in relationships
    carry certain stigmas. One popular rule of thumb is the
    [half-your-age-plus-seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#The_.22half-your-age-plus-seven.22_rule)
    rule. This rule states you should never date anyone under half your
    age plus seven, establishing a minimum boundary on whom one can
    date. In order for a dating relationship to be acceptable under this
    rule, your partner's age must be:

$$\frac{\text{Your age}}{2} + 7 < \text{Partner Age} < (\text{Your age} - 7) * 2$$
How frequently does this rule apply in this dataset?
-   Which movie has the greatest number of love interests?
-   Which actors/ actresses have the greatest number of love interests
    in this dataset?
-   Is the mean/median age difference staying constant over the years
    (1935 - 2022)?
-   How frequently does Hollywood depict same-gender love interests?

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr`
and `ggplot2` skills. It builds on exercise 1, the San Francisco rentals
data.

You have to create a graph that calculates the cumulative % change in
median rental prices for 0-, 1-, and 2-bed flats between 2000 and 2018
for the top twelve cities in Bay Area, by number of ads that appeared in
Craigslist. Your final graph should look like below. You may find
`dplyr::first()` a useful function

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
